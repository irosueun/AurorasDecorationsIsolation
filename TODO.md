  - blackboards on floor/ceiling

- xbxbxb123's ideas
  - Crystal Ball: made with quartz and amethyst, as well as magical materials. Has a different appearance depending on the magical material used.
    A few material ideas:
    Redstone makes it have a pulsing red glow visible on the inside
    lapis gives it a pulsing blue glow
    blaze powder gives it a magma/lava colored glow
    prismarine crystal makes it pulse between the prismatine accent colors
    dragon's breath gives it a purple glow
    a nether star gives it a bright white glow that smites nearby enemies similar to a fully powered conduit
  - Grandfather clocks with a swinging pendulum made of copper, wood, and a clock.
    They'd output a comparator signal strength depending on the time of day divided into 16 segments and emit a normal, non-comparator redstone pulse every 1000 ticks, aka every in game hour, on the hour
    and the pendulum could just be internal
    so no physics, just an animation
